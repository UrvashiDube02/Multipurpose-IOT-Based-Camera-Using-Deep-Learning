**Abstract**
<p align="justify">
The COVID 19 pandemic has given rise to a new normal. This includes wearing masks and maintaining social distance. Nowadays sudents don’t focus in offline classes. Also, students with masks in offline proctored exams find ways to roll their eyes at others’ work for malpractice. The systems designed to date are not accurate to detect facial features with mask. These problems have motivated us to develop a reliable, robust model to detect mask, eye location, eyeball location, eye status, and head pose of people wearing and not wearing a mask, all at once. We have used 3800 masked, unmasked images to train our model using MobileNetV2, a convolutional neural network, with 99% accuracy. The output of this model is processed using image processing, facial landmark analysis, EAR, and deep learning to detect the facial landmarks accurately. Ultimately, a unique method is used to detect head pose of person.</p>
